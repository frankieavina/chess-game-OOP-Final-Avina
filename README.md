# ChessGame
For my Angular project, I focused on practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles by developing a structured application. I created multiple classes to represent various entities, utilizing core OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. These classes interacted within the Angular framework to manage data flow, user interaction, and dynamic UI updates. The project also integrated Angular services to handle business logic, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and promoting reusable, maintainable code. Through this project, I reinforced my understanding of OOP within a modern front-end framework.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
